    "# Distinguishing tiles in one's pocket from tiles in the wild\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the challenge: Person X goes on a walk in the city, carrying a tile, and also a tile signal collector. X's tile rotates between a finite set of keys. X will obviously capture their own signal -- a certain number of *beacons* for each of the keys their tile is going through. They will also capture beacons from tiles in the pockets and bags of people they walk by. How can X distinguish the keys beaconed out of their tile from those of other people?\n",
    "\n",
    "One would think that the sustained proximity between the person's own tile and their detector will make it so the largest **number of beacons collected** should be for their own keys. However, this is a poor decision variable, as it depends on the number of keys being rotated through, as well as the beacon frequency for the tile. Some brands of tiles might send beacons at much higher frequencies, making beacon numbers an imprecise appreciation of key ownership. A much better variable to test over should be **signal strength** (as measured in decibels): since X's own tile will always be closer to the detector than other people's, we should see an appreciably stronger signal from the former than from the latter.\n",
